## Schematics

Schematics are really straighforward, with just 4 components

- Capacitor to smooth the NFC power generation.
- Resistor to current limit the LED.
- A Yellow LED
- [NFC NTAG: NT3H1101W0FHKH](card/elec/src/nfc/NT3H1101W0FHKH.ato)

The NT3H1101W0FHKH is really cool, a writable NFC tag that just needs an antenna.
It will generate enough power from the NFC field to light up a LED.
